# Batch background remover

This file loads all data from a directry called "TEST_DATA/" and removed all the backgrounds and saves it in a
directry called "TEST_DATA_MASKED/". Files keep their origional names, but saved in png.

Results are not prefect, but for what they are needed they get the job done.

This background remover was based off of https://github.com/nikhilroxtomar/Remove-Photo-Background-using-TensorFlow
